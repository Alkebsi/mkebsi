				Joanne Albertson waited a long time to 
				talk with her good friend face-to-face. 26 
				years ago, Joanne saw an advertisement 
				in the Manchester Evening News and 
				started sending letters to Anna Waters 
				in South Australia. The pen friends 
				finally met for the first time last month. 
				“It was amazing,” says Joanne. “When 
				she walked into the café I knew it was 
				her.” The friends plan to meet again on 
				holiday next year.
